PIT_IN_SCALE = 100.0 from 50.0
GEAR_SCALE = 300.0 from 250.0
COMPOUND_SCALE = 50.0 - the same
CONTINOUS_SCALE = 10.0 from 1.0

Experiment to get GEAR_SCALE higher -> Keep multiplying by x2

Ignore PIT_IN_SCALE for now!

Take original scales

PIT_IN_SCALE = 0.0 from 50.0
GEAR_SCALE = 250.0 from 250.0 [try 400.0, 600.0, 800.0, 1000.0]
COMPOUND_SCALE = 50.0 - the same
CONTINOUS_SCALE = 1.0 - the same

Introduced RobustScaler - see if it behaviour better then MinMaxScaler.
