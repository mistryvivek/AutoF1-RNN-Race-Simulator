# YRKCS-PRBX
Any programming related to my final year project titled "Using Formula One data captured during practice and qualifying sessions to create Race Pit Strategies using Machine Learning"

* /Pre-Learning: Anything labelled PADL is university resource used to provide background to the project.
* /Data: Data can be fetched from the FastF1 API, due to rate limiting issues, I have started to store my own local copy.
* If you want to run any notebooks, I would upload the data folder (after extracting) to your workspace and modify the base path variable accordingly.

Packages needed:
* https://github.com/theOehrly/Fast-F1
* Everything included with Google Collab.
