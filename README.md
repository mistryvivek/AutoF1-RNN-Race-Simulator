Any programming related to my final year project titled "Using Formula One data captured during practice and qualifying sessions to create Race Pit Strategies using Machine Learning"

* Anything labelled PADL is university resource used to provide background to the projects.
* If you want to run any notebooks, I would upload the data folder to your workspace.
